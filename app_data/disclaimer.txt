beam_io is a personal project made by a mechanical engineering student at the
University of Waterloo. 

I have applied concepts of solid mechanics and stress states to develop a tool 
capable of solving statically indeterminate structural problems.

beam_io IS A PERSONAL PROJECT. IT IS NOT FOR ENGINEERING USE. IT IS NOT A 
SUBSTITUTE FOR ENGINEERING/FEA SOFTWARE.
